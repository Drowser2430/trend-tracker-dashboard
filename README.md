TikTok Trend Tracker Dashboard ‚Äì Project Description
The TikTok Trend Tracker Dashboard is a custom-built Streamlit app that analyzes the lifecycle of trending hashtags and sounds on TikTok.

Using time-series data, the dashboard visualizes daily view growth for each hashtag and classifies its current trend phase as Rising, Peaking, or Fading. Built with Python, pandas, and matplotlib, this project demonstrates my ability to apply data visualization, business metrics, and content strategy analysis to real-world social media trends.

üîç Features:

Interactive line charts of hashtag engagement over time

Auto-generated trend phase classification

CSV export for business/marketing teams to use in planning

This project reflects my interest in helping platforms like TikTok improve content strategy, support creators, and enhance the user discovery experience through data-driven insights.
